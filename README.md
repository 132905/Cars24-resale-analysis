## 🧪 Key Analysis Performed

### 🔹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Handled missing values and irrelevant data
- Converted string-based numerical columns (e.g., *Mileage*, *Power*) to floats

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis

- Price distribution across car models, years, cities, and fuel types
- Aggregated insights on average prices by Fuel Type, Transmission, Owner Type, etc.
- Identified top-selling car models and cities with highest listings
- Year-wise and transmission-type mileage analysis

---

## 📊 Insights & Findings

- **Top Cities**: Cities with the most car listings and highest average resale prices
- **Fuel & Transmission**: Diesel cars generally have higher resale prices; automatics perform better in some cities
- **Ownership Impact**: First-owner cars retain better resale value than third or fourth-owner ones
- **Car Model Trends**: Specific models consistently have higher resale value
